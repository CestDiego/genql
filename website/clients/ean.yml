  The EAN includes the country of origin, the manufacturer and a product number. In addition to that it includes a checksum.

  When you only look at the barcode, you can't easily see which product it belongs to. Thus, this website provides a reverse EAN lookup, that tells you the product the EAN code belongs to.
